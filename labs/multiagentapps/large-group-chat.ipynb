      "6. **Scientist**: Validate the final markdown table for accuracy and completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Detailed Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Engineer**: Write a Python script using the arXiv API to fetch papers related to LLMs published in the last week.\n",
      "    - Use search terms like \"Large Language Model\", \"LLM\", \"GPT\", etc.\n",
      "    - Limit the search to the last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Engineer**: Filter the fetched papers to identify their application domains.\n",
      "    - Use keywords in the title and abstract to classify the papers into domains such as healthcare, finance, education, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Engineer**: Extract relevant information from the filtered papers.\n",
      "    - Extract the title, authors, abstract, and identified domain for each paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Scientist**: Review the extracted information.\n",
      "    - Ensure that the classification of domains is accurate.\n",
      "    - Make any necessary adjustments to the domain classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Engineer**: Create a markdown table with the reviewed information.\n",
      "    - Format the table with columns for Title, Authors, Abstract, and Domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Scientist**: Validate the final markdown table.\n",
      "    - Check for accuracy and completeness.\n",
      "    - Ensure that all relevant papers are included and correctly classified.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Domain Classification**: The plan mentions using keywords to classify papers into domains. It would be beneficial to provide a list of potential domains and associated keywords to guide the classification process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Error Handling**: Include steps for handling potential errors, such as network issues when fetching data from arXiv or cases where papers do not clearly fit into predefined domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Code Review**: Add a step for code review to ensure the script is efficient and free of bugs.\n",

Kegeles, Jia Guo | Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an established technique for studying tissue metabolism, particularly in central nervous system disorders. While powerful and versatile, MRS is often limited by challenges associated with data quality, processing, and quantification. Existing MRS quantification methods face difficulties in balancing model complexity and reproducibility during spectral modeling, often falling into the trap of either oversimplification or over-parameterization. To address these limitations, this study introduces a deep learning (DL) framework that employs transfer learning, in which the model is pre-trained on simulated datasets before it undergoes fine-tuning on in vivo data. The proposed framework showed promising performance when applied to the Philips dataset from the BIG GABA repository and represents an exciting advancement in MRS data analysis. | Healthcare | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15999v1) |\n",

Recent work indicates that enhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character recognition and document analysis. A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal using a mixture of vision encoders. Despite their success, there is a lack of systematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical aspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision experts. This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for MLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions. Our findings reveal several underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to a streamlined yet effective design approach. We discover that simply concatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as effective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies. We additionally introduce Pre-Alignment to bridge the gap between vision-focused encoders and language tokens, enhancing model coherence. The resulting family of MLLMs, Eagle, surpasses other leading open-source models on major MLLM benchmarks.

      "| Mamba or Transformer for Time Series Forecasting? Mixture of Universals (MoU) Is All You Need | Sijia Peng, Yun Xiong, Yangyong Zhu, Zhiqiang Shen | Time series forecasting requires balancing short-term and long-term dependencies for accurate predictions. Existing methods mainly focus on long-term dependency modeling, neglecting the complexities of short-term dynamics, which may hinder performance. Transformers are superior in modeling long-term dependencies but are criticized for their quadratic computational cost. Mamba provides a near-linear alternative but is reported less effective in time series longterm forecasting due to potential information loss. Current architectures fall short in offering both high efficiency and strong performance for long-term dependency modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Universals (MoU), a versatile model to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies for enhancing performance in time series forecasting. MoU is composed of two novel designs: Mixture of Feature Extractors (MoF), an adaptive method designed to improve time series patch representations for short-term dependency, and Mixture of Architectures (MoA), which hierarchically integrates Mamba, FeedForward, Convolution, and Self-Attention architectures in a specialized order to model long-term dependency from a hybrid perspective. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining relatively low computational costs. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoU. Code is available at https://github.com/lunaaa95/mou/. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15997v1) |\n",
      "| Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection | Wei-Jhe Huang, Min-Hung Chen, Shang-Hong Lai | Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

However, a core remaining challenge is the fine-grained and user-friendly editing of clothing styles by means of textual descriptions. To this end, we present TEDRA, the first method allowing text-based edits of an avatar, which maintains the avatar's high fidelity, space-time coherency, as well as dynamics, and enables skeletal pose and view control. We begin by training a model to create a controllable and high-fidelity digital replica of the real actor. Next, we personalize a pretrained generative diffusion model by fine-tuning it on various frames of the real character captured from different camera angles, ensuring the digital representation faithfully captures the dynamics and movements of the real person. This two-stage process lays the foundation for our approach to dynamic human avatar editing. Utilizing this personalized diffusion model, we modify the dynamic avatar based on a provided text prompt using our Personalized Normal Aligned Score Distillation Sampling (PNA-SDS) within a model-based guidance framework. Additionally, we propose a time step annealing strategy to ensure high-quality edits. Our results demonstrate a clear improvement over prior work in functionality and visual quality. | Natural Language Processing | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15995v1) |\n",
      "| Perceive-IR: Learning to Perceive Degradation Better for All-in-One Image Restoration | Xu Zhang, Jiaqi Ma, Guoli Wang, Qian Zhang, Huan Zhang, Lefei Zhang | The limitations of task-specific and general image restoration methods for specific degradation have prompted the development of all-in-one image restoration techniques. However, the diversity of patterns among multiple degradation, along with the significant uncertainties in mapping between degraded images of different severities and their corresponding undistorted versions, pose significant challenges to the all-in-one restoration tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Perceive-IR, an all-in-one image restorer designed to achieve fine-grained quality control that enables restored images to more closely resemble their undistorted counterparts, regardless of the type or severity of degradation. Specifically, Perceive-IR contains two stages: (1) prompt learning stage and (2) restoration stage. In the prompt learning stage, we leverage prompt learning to acquire a fine-grained quality perceiver capable of distinguishing three-tier quality levels by constraining the prompt-image similarity in the CLIP perception space. Subsequently, this quality perceiver and difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss are integrated as a quality-aware learning strategy to realize fine-grained quality control in restoration stage. For the restoration stage, a semantic guidance module (SGM) and compact feature extraction (CFE) are proposed to further promote the restoration process by utilizing the robust semantic information from the pre-trained large scale vision models and distinguishing degradation-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Perceive-IR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all-in-one image restoration tasks and exhibit superior generalization ability when dealing with unseen tasks. | Education | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15994v1) |\n",

The complexity of distinguishing human-induced climate signals from natural variability has challenged traditional detection and attribution (D&A) approaches, which seek to identify specific \"fingerprints\" in climate response variables.

ClimDetect integrates various input and target variables used in past research, ensuring comparability and consistency. We also explore the application of vision transformers (ViT) to climate data, a novel and modernizing approach in this context. Our open-access data and code serve as a benchmark for advancing climate science through improved model evaluations. ClimDetect is publicly accessible via Huggingface dataet respository at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ClimDetect/ClimDetect. | Education | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15993v1) |\n",
      "| CoGen: Learning from Feedback with Coupled Comprehension and Generation | Mustafa Omer Gul, Yoav Artzi | Systems with both language comprehension and generation capabilities can benefit from the tight connection between the two. This work studies coupling comprehension and generation with focus on continually learning from interaction with users. We propose techniques to tightly integrate the two capabilities for both learning and inference. We situate our studies in two-player reference games, and deploy various models for thousands of interactions with human users, while learning from interaction feedback signals. We show dramatic improvements in performance over time, with comprehension-generation coupling leading to performance improvements up to 26% in absolute terms and up to 17% higher accuracies compared to a non-coupled system. Our analysis also shows coupling has substantial qualitative impact on the system's language, making it significantly more human-like. | Education | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15992v1) |\n",
      "| Distribution Backtracking Builds A Faster Convergence Trajectory for One-step Diffusion Distillation | Shengyuan Zhang, Ling Yang, Zejian Li, An Zhao, Chenye Meng, Changyuan Yang, Guang Yang, Zhiyuan Yang, Lingyun Sun | Accelerating the sampling speed of diffusion models remains a significant challenge. Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into an one-step student generator, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack) for distilling student generators. DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of teacher models, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the intermediate distributions of teacher models. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions for approximating the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15991v1) |\n",
      "| A Control Theoretic Approach to Simultaneously Estimate Average Value of Time and Determine Dynamic Price for High-occupancy Toll Lanes | Xuting Wang, Wen-Long Jin, Yafeng Yin | The dynamic pricing problem of a freeway corridor with high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes was formulated and solved based on a point queue abstraction of the traffic system [Yin and Lou, 2009]. However, existing pricing strategies cannot guarantee that the closed-loop system converges to the optimal state, in which the HOT lanes' capacity is fully utilized but there is no queue on the HOT lanes, and a well-behaved estimation and control method is quite challenging and still elusive. This paper attempts to fill the gap by making three fundamental contributions: (i) to present a simpler formulation of the point queue model based on the new concept of residual capacity, (ii) to propose a simple feedback control theoretic approach to estimate the average value of time and calculate the dynamic price, and (iii) to analytically and numerically prove that the closed-loop system is stable and guaranteed to converge to the optimal state, in either Gaussian or exponential manners. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15990v1) |\n",
      "| Non-holomorphic Modular $S_4$ Lepton Flavour Models | Gui-Jun Ding, Jun-Nan Lu, S. T. Petcov, Bu-Yao Qu | In the formalism of the non-supersymmetric modular invariance approach to the flavour problem the elements of the Yukawa coupling and fermion mass matrices are expressed in terms of polyharmonic Maa{\\ss} modular forms of level $N$ in addition to the standard modula forms of the same level and a small number of constant parameters. Non-trivial polyharmonic Maa{\\ss} forms exist for zero, negative and positive integer modular weights. Employing the finite modula group $S_4$ as a flavour symmetry group and assuming that the three left-handed lepton doublets furnish a triplet irreducible representation of $S_4$, we construct all possible 7- and 8-parameter lepton flavour models in which the neutrino masses are generated either by the Weinberg effective operator or by the type I seesaw mechanism. We identify the phenomenologically viable models and obtain predictions for each of these models for the neutrino mass ordering, the absolute neutrino mass scale, the Dirac and Majorana CP-violation phases and, correspondingly, for the sum of neutrino masses and the neutrinoless double beta decay effective Majorana mass. We comment on how these models can be tested and conclude that they are all falsifiable. Detailed analyses are presented in the case of three representative benchmark lepton flavour scenarios. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15988v1) |\n",
      "| Investigation of Charged Higgs Bosons Production from Vector-Like $T$ Quark Decays at $eÎ³$ Collider | Rachid Benbrik, Mbark Berrouj, Mohammed Boukidi | Within the extended framework of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model Type II (2HDM-II) enhanced by a vector-like quark (VLQ) doublet $TB$, we conduct a detailed analysis of the process $e^{-}\\gamma \\rightarrow b\\nu_{e}\\bar{T}$ at future high-energy $e\\gamma$ colliders, focusing on the subsequent decays $\\bar{T} \\rightarrow H^{-} \\bar{b}$ and $H^{-} \\rightarrow \\bar{t}b$. Utilizing current theoretical and experimental constraints, we calculate production cross sections for both unpolarized and polarized beams at center-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s} = 2$ and 3 TeV, demonstrating that polarized beams significantly enhance detectability through higher production rates. By analyzing the kinematic distributions, we establish optimized selection criteria to effectively distinguish signal events from background. At $\\sqrt{s} = 2$ TeV with an integrated luminosity of 1500 fb$^{-1}$, we find exclusion regions within $s_R^d \\in [0.085, 0.16]$ for $m_T \\in [1000, 1260]$ GeV and a discovery potential within $s_R^d \\in [0.14, 0.17]$ for $m_T \\in [1000, 1100]$ GeV, with these regions expanding to $s_R^d \\in [0.05, 0.15]$ for $m_T \\in [1000, 1340]$ GeV and $s_R^d \\in [0.11, 0.17]$ for $m_T \\in [1000, 1160]$ GeV at 3000 fb$^{-1}$. At $\\sqrt{s} = 3$ TeV and 1500 fb$^{-1}$, we identify exclusion regions of $s_R^d \\in [0.055, 0.135]$ for $m_T \\in [1000, 1640]$ GeV and discovery regions of $s_R^d \\in [0.09, 0.15]$ for $m_T \\in [1000, 1400]$ GeV, which further expand to $s_R^d \\in [0.028, 0.12]$ for $m_T \\in [1000, 1970]$ GeV and $s_R^d \\in [0.04, 0.122]$ for $m_T \\in [1000, 1760]$ GeV at 3000 fb$^{-1}$. These findings highlight the enhanced detection potential at higher energies, particularly with polarized beams. The effects of initial state radiation, beamstrahlung, and systematic uncertainties are also considered, influencing both exclusion and discovery capabilities. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15985v1) |\n",

Wu, Lawrence S. Kegeles, Jia Guo | Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an established technique for\\nstudying tissue metabolism, particularly in central nervous system disorders.\\nWhile powerful and versatile, MRS is often limited by challenges associated\\nwith data quality, processing, and quantification. Existing MRS quantification\\nmethods face difficulties in balancing model complexity and reproducibility\\nduring spectral modeling, often falling into the trap of either\\noversimplification or over-parameterization. To address these limitations, this\\nstudy introduces a deep learning (DL) framework that employs transfer learning,\\nin which the model is pre-trained on simulated datasets before it undergoes\\nfine-tuning on in vivo data. The proposed framework showed promising\\nperformance when applied to the Philips dataset from the BIG GABA repository\\nand represents an exciting advancement in MRS data analysis. | Education | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15999v1) |\\n| Eagle: Exploring The Design Space for Multimodal LLMs with Mixture of Encoders | Min Shi, Fuxiao Liu, Shihao Wang, Shijia Liao, Subhashree Radhakrishnan, De-An Huang, Hongxu Yin, Karan Sapra, Yaser Yacoob, Humphrey Shi, Bryan Catanzaro, Andrew Tao, Jan Kautz, Zhiding Yu, Guilin Liu | The ability to accurately interpret complex visual information is a crucial\\ntopic of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent work indicates that\\nenhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves\\nperformance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character\\nrecognition and document analysis. A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal\\nusing a mixture of vision encoders. Despite their success, there is a lack of\\nsystematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical\\naspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision\\nexperts. This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for\\nMLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions. Our findings reveal\\nseveral underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to\\na streamlined yet effective design approach. We discover that simply\\nconcatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as\\neffective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies. We additionally\\nintroduce Pre-Alignment to bridge the gap between vision-focused encoders and\\nlanguage tokens, enhancing model coherence. The resulting family of MLLMs,\\nEagle, surpasses other leading open-source models on major MLLM benchmarks.\\nModels and code: https://github.com/NVlabs/Eagle | Natural Language Processing | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15998v1) |\\n| Mamba or Transformer for Time Series Forecasting? Mixture of Universals (MoU) Is All You Need | Sijia Peng, Yun Xiong, Yangyong Zhu, Zhiqiang Shen | Time series forecasting requires balancing short-term and long-term\\ndependencies for accurate predictions. Existing methods mainly focus on\\nlong-term dependency modeling, neglecting the complexities of short-term\\ndynamics, which may hinder performance. Transformers are superior in modeling\\nlong-term dependencies but are criticized for their quadratic computational\\ncost. Mamba provides a near-linear alternative but is reported less effective\\nin time series longterm forecasting due to potential information loss. Current\\narchitectures fall short in offering both high efficiency and strong\\nperformance for long-term dependency modeling. To address these challenges, we\\nintroduce Mixture of Universals (MoU), a versatile model to capture both\\nshort-term and long-term dependencies for enhancing performance in time series\\nforecasting. MoU is composed of two novel designs: Mixture of Feature\\nExtractors (MoF), an adaptive method designed to improve time series patch\\nrepresentations for short-term dependency, and Mixture of Architectures (MoA),\\nwhich hierarchically integrates Mamba, FeedForward, Convolution, and\\nSelf-Attention architectures in a specialized order to model long-term\\ndependency from a hybrid perspective. The proposed approach achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance while maintaining relatively low computational\\ncosts. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the\\nsuperiority of MoU.

Recent works aim to enhance this\\nprocess by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship\\nbetween people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have\\nprimarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies\\nin the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories.\\nIn this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect\\nunseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage\\nthe rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context\\nInteraction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual\\ninformation to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more\\nrepresentative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing\\ndistinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the\\nInterest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to\\nfind each person\\'s interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used\\nfor prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To\\nevaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive\\nbenchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets.

To this end, we\\npresent TEDRA, the first method allowing text-based edits of an avatar, which\\nmaintains the avatar\\'s high fidelity, space-time coherency, as well as\\ndynamics, and enables skeletal pose and view control. We begin by training a\\nmodel to create a controllable and high-fidelity digital replica of the real\\nactor. Next, we personalize a pretrained generative diffusion model by\\nfine-tuning it on various frames of the real character captured from different\\ncamera angles, ensuring the digital representation faithfully captures the\\ndynamics and movements of the real person. This two-stage process lays the\\nfoundation for our approach to dynamic human avatar editing. Utilizing this\\npersonalized diffusion model, we modify the dynamic avatar based on a provided\\ntext prompt using our Personalized Normal Aligned Score Distillation Sampling\\n(PNA-SDS) within a model-based guidance framework.

However, the diversity of patterns among multiple\\ndegradation, along with the significant uncertainties in mapping between\\ndegraded images of different severities and their corresponding undistorted\\nversions, pose significant challenges to the all-in-one restoration tasks. To\\naddress these challenges, we propose Perceive-IR, an all-in-one image restorer\\ndesigned to achieve fine-grained quality control that enables restored images\\nto more closely resemble their undistorted counterparts, regardless of the type\\nor severity of degradation. Specifically, Perceive-IR contains two stages: (1)\\nprompt learning stage and (2) restoration stage. In the prompt learning stage,\\nwe leverage prompt learning to acquire a fine-grained quality perceiver capable\\nof distinguishing three-tier quality levels by constraining the prompt-image\\nsimilarity in the CLIP perception space. Subsequently, this quality perceiver\\nand difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss are integrated as a quality-aware\\nlearning strategy to realize fine-grained quality control in restoration stage.\\nFor the restoration stage, a semantic guidance module (SGM) and compact feature\\nextraction (CFE) are proposed to further promote the restoration process by\\nutilizing the robust semantic information from the pre-trained large scale\\nvision models and distinguishing degradation-specific features. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate that our Perceive-IR outperforms state-of-the-art\\nmethods in all-in-one image restoration tasks and exhibit superior\\ngeneralization ability when dealing with unseen tasks. | Education | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15994v1) |\\n| ClimDetect: A Benchmark Dataset for Climate Change Detection and Attribution | Sungduk Yu, Brian L.

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into\\nan one-step student generator, which is optimized by calculating the difference\\nbetween the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model.\\nHowever, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation\\nprocess, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of\\npre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of\\nthe convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model.\\nTo address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing\\nthe entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution\\nBacktracking Distillation (DisBack) for distilling student generators. DisBask\\nis composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking.\\nDegradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of\\nteacher models, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher\\nmodel to the untrained initial student generator.

However, selecting\\nappropriate per-species thresholds to binarize these predictions is non-trivial\\nas different species can require distinct thresholds. In this work, we evaluate\\ndifferent approaches for automatically identifying the best thresholds for\\nbinarizing range maps using presence-only data. This includes approaches that\\nrequire the generation of additional pseudo-absence data, along with ones that\\nonly require presence data. We also propose an extension of an existing\\npresence-only technique that is more robust to outliers. We perform a detailed\\nevaluation of different thresholding techniques on the tasks of binary range\\nestimation and large-scale fine-grained visual classification, and we\\ndemonstrate improved performance over existing pseudo-absence free approaches\\nusing our method. | Education | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15956v1) |\\n| Fall Detection for Smart Living using YOLOv5 | Gracile Astlin Pereira | This work introduces a fall detection system using the YOLOv5mu model, which\\nachieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.995, demonstrating exceptional\\naccuracy in identifying fall events within smart home environments.

Waytowich, Devin White, MD Sunbeam, Vinicius G. Goecks | Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their\\ncapabilities beyond traditional text-based tasks to multimodal domains,\\nintegrating visual, auditory, and textual data. While multimodal LLMs have been\\nextensively explored for high-level planning in domains like robotics and\\ngames, their potential as low-level controllers remains largely untapped. This\\npaper explores the application of multimodal LLMs as low-level controllers in\\nthe domain of Atari video games, introducing Atari game performance as a new\\nbenchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal LLMs to perform low-level\\ncontrol tasks. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation\\nlearning (IL) methods that require extensive computational resources as well as\\nreward function specification, these LLMs utilize pre-existing multimodal\\nknowledge to directly engage with game environments. Our study assesses\\nmultiple multimodal LLMs performance against traditional RL agents, human\\nplayers, and random agents, focusing on their ability to understand and\\ninteract with complex visual scenes and formulate strategic responses.\\nAdditionally, we examine the impact of In-Context Learning (ICL) by\\nincorporating human-demonstrated game-play trajectories to enhance the models\\ncontextual understanding. Through this investigation, we aim to determine the\\nextent to which multimodal LLMs can leverage their extensive training to\\neffectively function as low-level controllers, thereby redefining potential\\napplications in dynamic and visually complex environments.

Chen, Xiao Chen, Terrence Chen, Shanhui Sun | Dynamic coronary roadmapping is a technology that overlays the vessel maps\\n(the \"roadmap\") extracted from an offline image sequence of X-ray angiography\\nonto a live stream of X-ray fluoroscopy in real-time. It aims to offer\\nnavigational guidance for interventional surgeries without the need for\\nrepeated contrast agent injections, thereby reducing the risks associated with\\nradiation exposure and kidney failure. The precision of the roadmaps is\\ncontingent upon the accurate alignment of angiographic and fluoroscopic images\\nbased on their cardiac phases, as well as precise catheter tip tracking. The\\nformer ensures the selection of a roadmap that closely matches the vessel shape\\nin the current frame, while the latter uses catheter tips as reference points\\nto adjust for translational motion between the roadmap and the present vessel\\ntree. Training deep learning models for both tasks is challenging and\\nunderexplored. However, incorporating catheter features into the models could\\noffer substantial benefits, given humans heavily rely on catheters to complete\\nthe tasks.

The approach combines the Laplace-Beltrami framework\\nfor image denoising and enhancement, introduced by Sochen, Kimmel and Malladi\\nabout 25 years ago, and the assignment flow approach introduced and studied by\\nthe authors.\\n  The sigma flow arises as Riemannian gradient flow of generalized harmonic\\nenergies and thus is governed by a nonlinear geometric PDE which determines a\\nharmonic map from a closed Riemannian domain manifold to a statistical\\nmanifold, equipped with the Fisher-Rao metric from information geometry. A\\nspecific ingredient of the sigma flow is the mutual dependency of the\\nRiemannian metric of the domain manifold on the evolving state. This makes the\\napproach amenable to machine learning in a specific way, by realizing this\\ndependency through a mapping with compact time-variant parametrization that can\\nbe learned from data. Proof of concept experiments demonstrate the expressivity\\nof the sigma flow model and prediction performance.\\n  Structural similarities to transformer network architectures and networks\\ngenerated by the geometric integration of sigma flows are pointed out, which\\nhighlights the connection to deep learning and, conversely, may stimulate the\\nuse of geometric design principles for structured prediction in other areas of\\nscientific machine learning. | Education | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15946v1) |\\n| Direct measurement of surface interactions experienced by sticky microcapsules made from environmentally benign materials | Hairou Yu, Christopher L.

The microcapsules,\\nfabricated using a Pickering emulsion template with a cinnamon oil core and\\ncalcium alginate shell, were characterized for size (5-6 microns in diameter)\\nand surface charge (-20 mV). We employed total internal reflection microscopy\\nand particle tracking to measure the microcapsule-boundary interactions and\\ndiffusion, from which potential energy and diffusivity profiles were derived.\\nThe potential energy profile was analyzed and simulated by considering\\nelectrostatic, gravitational, and tethered forces, while the diffusivity was\\ncompared to that of a solid particle-boundary interaction, inclusive of\\nhydrodynamic forces. The diffusivity was represented as a normalized diffusion\\ncoefficient to eliminate the impact of fluid viscosity. The normalized\\ndiffusion coefficient of polymer-shell microcapsules (0.02) was found to be an\\norder of magnitude smaller than that of solid polystyrene particles (0.2).

Protohalo Angular Momentum | Eduard Salvador-SolÃ©, Alberto Manrique | According to the Tidal Torque Theory (TTT), the angular momentum of haloes\\narises from the tidal torque produced on protohaloes by the mass fluctuations\\naround them. That approach, initially developed assuming protohaloes as random\\noverdense regions in the linear density field, was extended to the more\\nrealistic scenario that protohaloes are collapsing patches around peaks in the\\nGaussian-smoothed linear density field. But that extension faced two\\nfundamental issues: 1) the unknown mass of collapsing patches marked by\\nGaussian peaks, and 2) the unknown ellipsoidal collapse time of those triaxial\\npatches. Furthermore, the TTT strictly holds in linear regime only. This Paper\\nis the first of a series of two devoted to revisiting the TTT and accurately\\ncalculating the halo angular momentum. In the present Paper we use the CUSP\\nformalism fixing all those issues to deal with the TTT from a full peak model\\nviewpoint, i.e. not only is the protohalo suffering the tidal torque identified\\nto a peak, but the main mass fluctuation causing the tidal torque is also seen\\nas a peak or a hole. This way we obtain a simple analytic expression for the\\nLagrangian protohalo AM, which can be readily implemented in galaxy formation\\nmodels and be compared to the results of simulations. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15939v1) |\\n| Fast quantum interconnects via constant-rate entanglement distillation | Christopher A.

Contrarily to the former bias, the latter is not\\nunderstood within the Press-Schechter (PS) and excursion set (ES) formalisms of\\nstructure formation, where protohalos are fully characterised by their height\\nand scale. As halos in different backgrounds undergo mergers at different\\nrates, the secondary bias was suggested not to be innate but to arise from the\\ndistinct assembly history of halos. However, it has recently been proven that\\nmergers leave no imprint in halo properties. But, in the peak model of\\nstructure formation, the secondary bias could still be innate and arise from\\nthe different typical curvature of peaks lying in different backgrounds. Here\\nwe show that this is the case, indeed. Using the CUSP formalism, we find that\\npeaks lying in different backgrounds with different typical curvatures evolve\\nin halos with different density profiles which in turn lead to many other\\ndistinct properties. The dependence we find of halo bias with those properties\\nreproduces the results of simulations. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15935v1) |\\n| Evaluating near-surface wind speeds simulated by the CRCM6-GEM5 model using AmeriFlux data over North America | Tim Whittaker, Alejandro Di Luca, Francois Roberge, Katja Winger | We evaluate the performance of various configurations of the Canadian\\nRegional Climate Model (CRCM6-GEM5) in simulating 10-meter wind speeds using\\ndata from 27 AmeriFlux stations across North America.

Measurements of the system,\\ncoupled to a single-mode environment, reveal a time-dependent shift in the\\nsystem\\'s energy levels of up to 15% of the bare system frequency.

To avoid huge cost brought by manual\\npreparation of instruction datasets and training resources up to hundreds of\\nhours, the exploitation of open knowledge including a wealth of low rank\\nadaptation (LoRA) models and instruction datasets serves as a good starting\\npoint. However, existing methods on model and data selection focus on the\\nperformance of general-purpose capabilities while neglecting the knowledge gap\\nexposed in domain-specific deployment. In the present study, we propose to\\nbridge such gap by introducing few human-annotated samples (i.e., K-shot) for\\nadvancing task expertise of LLMs with open knowledge. Specifically, we develop\\nan efficient and scalable pipeline to cost-efficiently produce task experts\\nwhere K-shot data intervene in selecting the most promising expert candidates\\nand the task-relevant instructions. A mixture-of-expert (MoE) system is built\\nto make the best use of individual-yet-complementary knowledge between multiple\\nexperts. We unveil the two keys to the success of a MoE system, 1) the abidance\\nby K-shot, and 2) the insistence on diversity. For the former, we ensure that\\nmodels that truly possess problem-solving abilities on K-shot are selected\\nrather than those blind guessers. Besides, during data selection, instructions\\nthat share task-relevant contexts with K-shot are prioritized. For the latter,\\nwe highlight the diversity of constituting experts and that of the fine-tuning\\ninstructions throughout the model and data selection process. Extensive\\nexperimental results confirm the superiority of our approach over existing\\nmethods on utilization of open knowledge across various tasks. Codes and models\\nwill be released later. | Natural Language Processing | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15915v1) |\\n| A simulation platform for slender, semiflexible, and inextensible fibers with Brownian hydrodynamics and steric repulsion | Ondrej Maxian, Aleksandar Donev | The last few years have seen an explosion of new numerical methods for\\nfilament hydrodynamics. Aside from their ubiquity in biology, physics, and\\nengineering, filaments present unique challenges from an applied-mathematical\\npoint of view. Their slenderness, inextensibility, semiflexibility, and\\nmeso-scale nature all require numerical methods that can handle multiple\\nlengthscales in the presence of constraints. Accounting for Brownian motion\\nwhile keeping the dynamics in detailed balance and on the constraint is\\ndifficult, as is including a background solvent, which couples the dynamics of\\nmultiple filaments together in a suspension. In this paper, we present a\\nsimulation platform for deterministic and Brownian inextensible filament\\ndynamics which includes nonlocal fluid dynamics and steric repulsion. We first\\nreview previous work, in which we formulated the equations and spatial\\ndiscretization for deterministic and Brownian inextensible filament dynamics.\\nWe then present novel methods for nonlocal fluid dynamics and steric replusion.\\nIn the former case, we define the mobility on a single filament using line\\nintegrals of Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa regularized singularities, and numerically\\npreserve the symmetric positive definite property by using a thicker\\nregularization width for the nonlocal integrals than for the self term. For\\nsteric repulsion, we introduce a soft local repulsive potential defined as a\\ndouble-integral over two filaments, then present a scheme to identify and\\nevaluate the nonzero components of the integrand. We demonstrate that Langevin\\ndynamics sample from the equilibrium distribution of free filament shapes, and\\nthat the modeling error in using the thicker regularization is small. We\\nconclude with two examples, sedimenting filaments and cross-linked fiber\\nnetworks, in which nonlocal hydrodynamics does and does not generate long-range\\nflow fields, respectively. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15913v1) |\\n| Investigating two-loop effects for first-order electroweak phase transitions | Lauri Niemi, Tuomas V.

A total\\nsample of 594 O- and B-type stars with measured macroturbulent velocities was\\ncomposed by complementing our sample with archival data. Furthermore, we\\ncompute an extensive grid of MESA models to compare, in a statistical manner,\\nthe predicted interior properties of stars (such as convection and wave\\npropagation) with the inference of macroturbulent velocities from\\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic observations.

Our approach tackles two fundamental\\nchallenges in MLLM distillation. First, we optimize the network structure of\\ns-MLLM by integrating a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture into the\\nlanguage model, striking a balance between computational efficiency and model\\nexpressiveness. Second, we propose a progressive knowledge transfer strategy to\\nensure comprehensive knowledge migration. This strategy begins with mimic\\ndistillation, where we minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between\\noutput distributions to enable the student model to emulate the teacher\\nnetwork\\'s understanding. Following this, we introduce preference distillation\\nvia Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), where the key lies in treating l-MLLM\\nas the reference model. During this phase, the s-MLLM\\'s ability to discriminate\\nbetween superior and inferior examples is significantly enhanced beyond l-MLLM,\\nleading to a better student that surpasses its teacher, particularly in\\nhallucination benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-MoD\\noutperforms existing models across various multimodal benchmarks while\\nmaintaining a minimal number of activated parameters and low computational\\ncosts. Remarkably, LLaVA-MoD, with only 2B activated parameters, surpasses\\nQwen-VL-Chat-7B by an average of 8.8% across benchmarks, using merely 0.3% of\\nthe training data and 23% trainable parameters. These results underscore\\nLLaVA-MoD\\'s ability to effectively distill comprehensive knowledge from its\\nteacher model, paving the way for the development of more efficient MLLMs. The\\ncode will be available on: https://github.com/shufangxun/LLaVA-MoD. | Natural Language Processing | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15881v1) |\\n| Certifying high-dimensional quantum channels | Sophie Engineer, Suraj Goel, Sophie Egelhaaf, Will McCutcheon, Vatshal Srivastav, Saroch Leedumrongwatthanakun, Sabine Wollmann, Ben Jones, Thomas Cope, Nicolas Brunner, Roope Uola, Mehul Malik | The use of high-dimensional systems for quantum communication opens\\ninteresting perspectives, such as increased information capacity and noise\\nresilience. In this context, it is crucial to certify that a given quantum\\nchannel can reliably transmit high-dimensional quantum information. Here we\\ndevelop efficient methods for the characterization of high-dimensional quantum\\nchannels. We first present a notion of dimensionality of quantum channels, and\\ndevelop efficient certification methods for this quantity. We consider a simple\\nprepare-and-measure setup, and provide witnesses for both a fully and a\\npartially trusted scenario. In turn we apply these methods to a photonic\\nexperiment and certify dimensionalities up to 59 for a commercial graded-index\\nmulti-mode optical fiber. Moreover, we present extensive numerical simulations\\nof the experiment, providing an accurate noise model for the fiber and\\nexploring the potential of more sophisticated witnesses.

This paper explores the\\npotential of LLMs, to shape human perspectives and subsequently influence their\\ndecisions on particular tasks. This capability finds applications in diverse\\ndomains such as Investment, Credit cards and Insurance, wherein they assist\\nusers in selecting appropriate insurance policies, investment plans, Credit\\ncards, Retail, as well as in Behavioral Change Support Systems (BCSS).\\n  We present a sophisticated multi-agent framework wherein a consortium of\\nagents operate in collaborative manner.

The SASV system integrates ASV and CM systems to enhance security\\nagainst spoofing attacks. Our approach employs score and embedding fusion from\\nASV models (ECAPA-TDNN, WavLM) and CM models (AASIST). The fused embeddings are\\nprocessed using a simple DNN structure, optimizing model performance with a\\ncombination of recently proposed a-DCF and BCE losses. We introduce a novel\\nparallel network structure where two identical DNNs, fed with different inputs,\\nindependently process embeddings and produce SASV scores. The final SASV\\nprobability is derived by averaging these scores, enhancing robustness and\\naccuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed parallel DNN\\nstructure outperforms traditional single DNN methods, offering a more reliable\\nand secure speaker verification system against spoofing attacks. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15877v1) |\\n| Unleashing the Temporal-Spatial Reasoning Capacity of GPT for Training-Free Audio and Language Referenced Video Object Segmentation | Shaofei Huang, Rui Ling, Hongyu Li, Tianrui Hui, Zongheng Tang, Xiaoming Wei, Jizhong Han, Si Liu | In this paper, we propose an Audio-Language-Referenced SAM 2 (AL-Ref-SAM 2)\\npipeline to explore the training-free paradigm for audio and\\nlanguage-referenced video object segmentation, namely AVS and RVOS tasks. The\\nintuitive solution leverages GroundingDINO to identify the target object from a\\nsingle frame and SAM 2 to segment the identified object throughout the video,\\nwhich is less robust to spatiotemporal variations due to a lack of video\\ncontext exploration. Thus, in our AL-Ref-SAM 2 pipeline, we propose a novel\\nGPT-assisted Pivot Selection (GPT-PS) module to instruct GPT-4 to perform\\ntwo-step temporal-spatial reasoning for sequentially selecting pivot frames and\\npivot boxes, thereby providing SAM 2 with a high-quality initial object prompt.\\nWithin GPT-PS, two task-specific Chain-of-Thought prompts are designed to\\nunleash GPT\\'s temporal-spatial reasoning capacity by guiding GPT to make\\nselections based on a comprehensive understanding of video and reference\\ninformation.

Information\\nstorage (IS), the main measure quantifying the active utilization of memory in\\na dynamic system, is only defined for discrete-time processes. While recent\\ntheoretical work laid the foundations for the continuous-time analysis of the\\npredictive capacity stored in a process, methods for the effective computation\\nof the related measures are needed to favor widespread utilization on neural\\ndata. This work introduces a method for the model-free estimation of the\\nso-called memory utilization rate (MUR), the continuous-time counterpart of the\\nIS, specifically designed to quantify the predictive capacity stored in neural\\npoint processes. The method employs nearest-neighbor entropy estimation applied\\nto the inter-spike intervals measured from point-process realizations to\\nquantify the extent of memory used by a spike train. An empirical procedure\\nbased on surrogate data is implemented to compensate the estimation bias and\\ndetect statistically significant levels of memory. The method is validated in\\nsimulated Poisson processes and in realistic models of coupled cortical\\ndynamics and heartbeat dynamics. It is then applied to real spike trains\\nreflecting central and autonomic nervous system activities: in spontaneously\\ngrowing cortical neuron cultures, the MUR detected increasing memory\\nutilization across maturation stages, associated to emergent bursting\\nsynchronized activity; in the study of the neuro-autonomic modulation of human\\nheartbeats, the MUR reflected the sympathetic activation occurring with\\npostural but not with mental stress. The proposed approach offers a\\ncomputationally reliable tool to analyze spike train data in computational\\nneuroscience and physiology. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15875v1) |\\n| Constructing a Common Ground: Analyzing the quality and usage of International Auxiliary Languages in Wikipedia | Marta Alet, Diego Saez-Trumper | International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) are constructed languages designed\\nto facilitate communication among speakers of different native languages while\\nfostering equality, efficiency, and cross-cultural understanding. This study\\nfocuses on analyzing the editions of IALs on Wikipedia, including Simple\\nEnglish, Esperanto, Ido, Interlingua, Volapuk, Interlingue, and Novial.

Although this is not a negligible amount of content, in\\ncomparison with large natural language projects there is still a big room for\\nimprovement. We concluded that IAL editions on Wikipedia are similar to other\\nprojects, behaving proportionally to their communities\\' size. Therefore, the\\nkey to their growth is augmenting the amount and quality of the content offered\\nin these languages. To that end, we offer a set of statistics to understand and\\nimprove these projects, and we developed a webpage that displays our findings\\nto foster knowledge sharing and facilitate the expansion of the IAL\\ncommunities. | Natural Language Processing | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15873v1) |\\n| BIM-SLAM: Integrating BIM Models in Multi-session SLAM for Lifelong Mapping using 3D LiDAR | Miguel Arturo Vega Torres, Alexander Braun, AndrÃ© Borrmann | While 3D LiDAR sensor technology is becoming more advanced and cheaper every\\nday, the growth of digitalization in the AEC industry contributes to the fact\\nthat 3D building information models (BIM models) are now available for a large\\npart of the built environment. These two facts open the question of how 3D\\nmodels can support 3D LiDAR long-term SLAM in indoor, GPS-denied environments.\\nThis paper proposes a methodology that leverages BIM models to create an\\nupdated map of indoor environments with sequential LiDAR measurements. Session\\ndata (pose graph-based map and descriptors) are initially generated from BIM\\nmodels. Then, real-world data is aligned with the session data from the model\\nusing multi-session anchoring while minimizing the drift on the real-world\\ndata. Finally, the new elements not present in the BIM model are identified,\\ngrouped, and reconstructed in a surface representation, allowing a better\\nvisualization next to the BIM model. The framework enables the creation of a\\ncoherent map aligned with the BIM model that does not require prior knowledge\\nof the initial pose of the robot, and it does not need to be inside the map. | Robotics | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15870v1) |\\n| Catastrophic cooling in optically thin plasmas | Tim Waters, Amanda Stricklan | The solar corona is the prototypical example of a low density environment\\nheated to high temperatures by external sources. The plasma cools radiatively,\\nand because it is optically thin to this radiation, it becomes possible to\\nmodel the density, velocity, and temperature structure of the system by\\nmodifying the MHD equations to include energy source terms that approximate the\\nlocal heating and cooling rates. The solutions can be highly inhomogeneous and\\neven multiphase because the well known linear instability associated with these\\nsource terms, thermal instability, leads to a catastrophic heating and cooling\\nof the plasma in the nonlinear regime. Here we show that there is a separate,\\nmuch simpler instance of catastrophic heating and cooling accompanying these\\nsource terms that can rival thermal instability in dynamical importance. The\\nlinear stability criterion is the isochoric one identified by Parker (1953),\\nand we demonstrate that cooling functions derived from collisional ionization\\nequilibrium are highly prone to violating this criterion. If catastrophic\\ncooling instability can act locally in global simulations, then it is an\\nalternative mechanism for forming condensations, and due to its nonequilibrium\\ncharacter, it may be relevant to explaining a host of phenomena associated with\\nthe production of cooler gas in hot, low density plasmas. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15869v1) |\\n| GenDDS: Generating Diverse Driving Video Scenarios with Prompt-to-Video Generative Model | Yongjie Fu, Yunlong Li, Xuan Di | Autonomous driving training requires a diverse range of datasets encompassing\\nvarious traffic conditions, weather scenarios, and road types.

Although numerous effective defense techniques have been proposed in\\nrecent years, they inevitably rely on the availability of either clean or\\npoisoned data. In contrast, data-free defense techniques have evolved slowly\\nand still lag significantly in performance. To address this issue, different\\nfrom the traditional approach of pruning followed by fine-tuning, we propose a\\nnovel data-free defense method named Optimal Transport-based Backdoor Repairing\\n(OTBR) in this work. This method, based on our findings on neuron weight\\nchanges (NWCs) of random unlearning, uses optimal transport (OT)-based model\\nfusion to combine the advantages of both pruned and backdoored models.\\nSpecifically, we first demonstrate our findings that the NWCs of random\\nunlearning are positively correlated with those of poison unlearning. Based on\\nthis observation, we propose a random-unlearning NWC pruning technique to\\neliminate the backdoor effect and obtain a backdoor-free pruned model. Then,\\nmotivated by the OT-based model fusion, we propose the pruned-to-backdoored\\nOT-based fusion technique, which fuses pruned and backdoored models to combine\\nthe advantages of both, resulting in a model that demonstrates high clean\\naccuracy and a low attack success rate. To our knowledge, this is the first\\nwork to apply OT and model fusion techniques to backdoor defense. Extensive\\nexperiments show that our method successfully defends against all seven\\nbackdoor attacks across three benchmark datasets, outperforming both\\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) data-free and data-dependent methods.

While no single tune describes all the data with\\ndifferent beam configurations, we find that a good agreement can still be found\\nwithin the same model by adjusting the relevant parameters separately for\\n$\\\\gamma\\\\gamma$, $\\\\gamma p$ and $pp$.

We use the RATPaC\\ncode to model the particle acceleration at the SNRs with progenitors having\\nZAMS masses of 20 Msol and 60 Msol. We have constructed the pre-supernova\\ncircumstellar medium by solving the hydrodynamic equations for the lifetime of\\nthe progenitor stars. Then, the transport equation for cosmic rays, and\\nmagnetic turbulence in test-particle approximation along with the induction\\nequation for the evolution of large-scale magnetic field have been solved\\nsimultaneously with the hydrodynamic equations for the expansion of SNRs inside\\nthe pre-supernova CSM.\\n  The structure of the wind bubbles along with the magnetic field and the\\nscattering turbulence regulate the spectra of accelerated particles for both\\nSNRs. For the 60 Msol progenitor the spectral index reaches 2.4 even below 10\\nGeV during the propagation of the SNR shock inside the hot shocked wind. In\\ncontrast, we have not observed persistent soft spectra at earlier evolutionary\\nstages of the SNR with 20 Msol progenitor, for which the spectral index becomes\\n2.2 only for a brief period. Later, the spectra become soft above ~10 GeV for\\nboth SNRs, as weak driving of turbulence permits the escape of high-energy\\nparticles from the remnants. The emission morphology of the SNRs strongly\\ndepends on the type of progenitors. For instance, the radio morphology of the\\nSNR with 20 Msol progenitor is centre-filled at early stages whereas that for\\nthe more massive progenitor is shell-like. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15839v1) |\\n| Dynamics of Nonlinear Lattices | Christopher Chong, P. G. Kevrekidis | In this topical review we explore the dynamics of nonlinear lattices with a\\nparticular focus to Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type models that arise in the\\nstudy of elastic media and, more specifically, granular crystals. We first\\nrevisit the workhorse of such lattices, namely traveling waves, both from a\\ncontinuum, but also from a genuinely discrete perspective, both without and\\nwith a linear force component (induced by the so-called precompression). We\\nthen extend considerations to time-periodic states, examining dark breather\\nstructures in homogeneous crystals, as well as bright breathers in diatomic\\nlattices. The last pattern that we consider extensively is the dispersive shock\\nwave arising in the context of suitable Riemann (step) initial data. We show\\nhow the use of continuum (KdV) and discrete (Toda) integrable approximations\\ncan be used to get a first quantitative handle of the relevant waveforms. In\\nall cases, theoretical analysis is accompanied by numerical computations and,\\nwhere possible, by a recap and illustration of prototypical experimental\\nresults. We close the chapter by offering a number of ongoing and potential\\nfuture directions and associated open problems in the field. | Natural Language Processing | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15837v1) |\\n| Knowledge Navigator: LLM-guided Browsing Framework for Exploratory Search in Scientific Literature | Uri Katz, Mosh Levy, Yoav Goldberg | The exponential growth of scientific literature necessitates advanced tools\\nfor effective knowledge exploration.

Local learning of\\nthe one-body direct correlation functional is based on Monte Carlo simulations\\nof inhomogeneous systems with randomized thermodynamic conditions, randomized\\nplanar shapes of the external potential, and randomized box sizes. Focusing on\\nthe prototypical Lennard-Jones system, we test predictions of the resulting\\nneural attractive density functional across a broad spectrum of physical\\nbehaviour associated with liquid-gas phase coexistence in bulk and at\\ninterfaces.

Wu, Lawrence S. Kegeles, Jia Guo | Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an established technique for studying tissue metabolism, particularly in central nervous system disorders. While powerful and versatile, MRS is often limited by challenges associated with data quality, processing, and quantification. Existing MRS quantification methods face difficulties in balancing model complexity and reproducibility during spectral modeling, often falling into the trap of either oversimplification or over-parameterization. To address these limitations, this study introduces a deep learning (DL) framework that employs transfer learning, in which the model is pre-trained on simulated datasets before it undergoes fine-tuning on in vivo data. The proposed framework showed promising performance when applied to the Philips dataset from the BIG GABA repository and represents an exciting advancement in MRS data analysis. | Healthcare | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15999v1) |\\n| Eagle: Exploring The Design Space for Multimodal LLMs with Mixture of Encoders | Min Shi, Fuxiao Liu, Shihao Wang, Shijia Liao, Subhashree Radhakrishnan, De-An Huang, Hongxu Yin, Karan Sapra, Yaser Yacoob, Humphrey Shi, Bryan Catanzaro, Andrew Tao, Jan Kautz, Zhiding Yu, Guilin Liu | The ability to accurately interpret complex visual information is a crucial topic of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent work indicates that enhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character recognition and document analysis. A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal using a mixture of vision encoders. Despite their success, there is a lack of systematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical aspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision experts. This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for MLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions. Our findings reveal several underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to a streamlined yet effective design approach. We discover that simply concatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as effective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies. We additionally introduce Pre-Alignment to bridge the gap between vision-focused encoders and language tokens, enhancing model coherence. The resulting family of MLLMs, Eagle, surpasses other leading open-source models on major MLLM benchmarks.

Mixture of Universals (MoU) Is All You Need | Sijia Peng, Yun Xiong, Yangyong Zhu, Zhiqiang Shen | Time series forecasting requires balancing short-term and long-term dependencies for accurate predictions. Existing methods mainly focus on long-term dependency modeling, neglecting the complexities of short-term dynamics, which may hinder performance. Transformers are superior in modeling long-term dependencies but are criticized for their quadratic computational cost. Mamba provides a near-linear alternative but is reported less effective in time series longterm forecasting due to potential information loss. Current architectures fall short in offering both high efficiency and strong performance for long-term dependency modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Universals (MoU), a versatile model to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies for enhancing performance in time series forecasting. MoU is composed of two novel designs: Mixture of Feature Extractors (MoF), an adaptive method designed to improve time series patch representations for short-term dependency, and Mixture of Architectures (MoA), which hierarchically integrates Mamba, FeedForward, Convolution, and Self-Attention architectures in a specialized order to model long-term dependency from a hybrid perspective. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining relatively low computational costs. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoU.

Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person\\'s interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

However, a core remaining challenge is the fine-grained and user-friendly editing of clothing styles by means of textual descriptions. To this end, we present TEDRA, the first method allowing text-based edits of an avatar, which maintains the avatar\\'s high fidelity, space-time coherency, as well as dynamics, and enables skeletal pose and view control. We begin by training a model to create a controllable and high-fidelity digital replica of the real actor. Next, we personalize a pretrained generative diffusion model by fine-tuning it on various frames of the real character captured from different camera angles, ensuring the digital representation faithfully captures the dynamics and movements of the real person. This two-stage process lays the foundation for our approach to dynamic human avatar editing. Utilizing this personalized diffusion model, we modify the dynamic avatar based on a provided text prompt using our Personalized Normal Aligned Score Distillation Sampling (PNA-SDS) within a model-based guidance framework. Additionally, we propose a time step annealing strategy to ensure high-quality edits. Our results demonstrate a clear improvement over prior work in functionality and visual quality. | Natural Language Processing | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15995v1) |\\n| Perceive-IR: Learning to Perceive Degradation Better for All-in-One Image Restoration | Xu Zhang, Jiaqi Ma, Guoli Wang, Qian Zhang, Huan Zhang, Lefei Zhang | The limitations of task-specific and general image restoration methods for specific degradation have prompted the development of all-in-one image restoration techniques. However, the diversity of patterns among multiple degradation, along with the significant uncertainties in mapping between degraded images of different severities and their corresponding undistorted versions, pose significant challenges to the all-in-one restoration tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Perceive-IR, an all-in-one image restorer designed to achieve fine-grained quality control that enables restored images to more closely resemble their undistorted counterparts, regardless of the type or severity of degradation. Specifically, Perceive-IR contains two stages: (1) prompt learning stage and (2) restoration stage. In the prompt learning stage, we leverage prompt learning to acquire a fine-grained quality perceiver capable of distinguishing three-tier quality levels by constraining the prompt-image similarity in the CLIP perception space. Subsequently, this quality perceiver and difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss are integrated as a quality-aware learning strategy to realize fine-grained quality control in restoration stage. For the restoration stage, a semantic guidance module (SGM) and compact feature extraction (CFE) are proposed to further promote the restoration process by utilizing the robust semantic information from the pre-trained large scale vision models and distinguishing degradation-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Perceive-IR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all-in-one image restoration tasks and exhibit superior generalization ability when dealing with unseen tasks. | Education | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15994v1) |\\n| ClimDetect: A Benchmark Dataset for Climate Change Detection and Attribution | Sungduk Yu, Brian L. White, Anahita Bhiwandiwalla, Musashi Hinck, Matthew Lyle Olson, Tung Nguyen, Vasudev Lal | Detecting and attributing temperature increases due to climate change is crucial for understanding global warming and guiding adaptation strategies. The complexity of distinguishing human-induced climate signals from natural variability has challenged traditional detection and attribution (D&A) approaches, which seek to identify specific \"fingerprints\" in climate response variables. Deep learning offers potential for discerning these complex patterns in expansive spatial datasets. However, lack of standard protocols has hindered consistent comparisons across studies. We introduce ClimDetect, a standardized dataset of over 816k daily climate snapshots, designed to enhance model accuracy in identifying climate change signals. ClimDetect integrates various input and target variables used in past research, ensuring comparability and consistency. We also explore the application of vision transformers (ViT) to climate data, a novel and modernizing approach in this context. Our open-access data and code serve as a benchmark for advancing climate science through improved model evaluations.

We situate our studies in two-player reference games, and deploy various models for thousands of interactions with human users, while learning from interaction feedback signals. We show dramatic improvements in performance over time, with comprehension-generation coupling leading to performance improvements up to 26% in absolute terms and up to 17% higher accuracies compared to a non-coupled system. Our analysis also shows coupling has substantial qualitative impact on the system\\'s language, making it significantly more human-like. | Education | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15992v1) |\\n| Distribution Backtracking Builds A Faster Convergence Trajectory for One-step Diffusion Distillation | Shengyuan Zhang, Ling Yang, Zejian Li, An Zhao, Chenye Meng, Changyuan Yang, Guang Yang, Zhiyuan Yang, Lingyun Sun | Accelerating the sampling speed of diffusion models remains a significant challenge. Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into an one-step student generator, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack) for distilling student generators. DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of teacher models, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the intermediate distributions of teacher models. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions for approximating the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance.

However, existing pricing strategies cannot guarantee that the closed-loop system converges to the optimal state, in which the HOT lanes\\' capacity is fully utilized but there is no queue on the HOT lanes, and a well-behaved estimation and control method is quite challenging and still elusive. This paper attempts to fill the gap by making three fundamental contributions: (i) to present a simpler formulation of the point queue model based on the new concept of residual capacity, (ii) to propose a simple feedback control theoretic approach to estimate the average value of time and calculate the dynamic price, and (iii) to analytically and numerically prove that the closed-loop system is stable and guaranteed to converge to the optimal state, in either Gaussian or exponential manners. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15990v1) |\\n| Non-holomorphic Modular $S_4$ Lepton Flavour Models | Gui-Jun Ding, Jun-Nan Lu, S. T. Petcov, Bu-Yao Qu | In the formalism of the non-supersymmetric modular invariance approach to the flavour problem the elements of the Yukawa coupling and fermion mass matrices are expressed in terms of polyharmonic Maa{\\\\ss} modular forms of level $N$ in addition to the standard modula forms of the same level and a small number of constant parameters. Non-trivial polyharmonic Maa{\\\\ss} forms exist for zero, negative and positive integer modular weights. Employing the finite modula group $S_4$ as a flavour symmetry group and assuming that the three left-handed lepton doublets furnish a triplet irreducible representation of $S_4$, we construct all possible 7- and 8-parameter lepton flavour models in which the neutrino masses are generated either by the Weinberg effective operator or by the type I seesaw mechanism. We identify the phenomenologically viable models and obtain predictions for each of these models for the neutrino mass ordering, the absolute neutrino mass scale, the Dirac and Majorana CP-violation phases and, correspondingly, for the sum of neutrino masses and the neutrinoless double beta decay effective Majorana mass. We comment on how these models can be tested and conclude that they are all falsifiable. Detailed analyses are presented in the case of three representative benchmark lepton flavour scenarios. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15988v1) |\\n| Investigation of Charged Higgs Bosons Production from Vector-Like $T$ Quark Decays at $eÎ³$ Collider | Rachid Benbrik, Mbark Berrouj, Mohammed Boukidi | Within the extended framework of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model Type II (2HDM-II) enhanced by a vector-like quark (VLQ) doublet $TB$, we conduct a detailed analysis of the process $e^{-}\\\\gamma \\\\rightarrow b\\\\nu_{e}\\\\bar{T}$ at future high-energy $e\\\\gamma$ colliders, focusing on the subsequent decays $\\\\bar{T} \\\\rightarrow H^{-} \\\\bar{b}$ and $H^{-} \\\\rightarrow \\\\bar{t}b$.

By analyzing the kinematic distributions, we establish optimized selection criteria to effectively distinguish signal events from background. At $\\\\sqrt{s} = 2$ TeV with an integrated luminosity of 1500 fb$^{-1}$, we find exclusion regions within $s_R^d \\\\in [0.085, 0.16]$ for $m_T \\\\in [1000, 1260]$ GeV and a discovery potential within $s_R^d \\\\in [0.14, 0.17]$ for $m_T \\\\in [1000, 1100]$ GeV, with these regions expanding to $s_R^d \\\\in [0.05, 0.15]$ for $m_T \\\\in [1000, 1340]$ GeV and $s_R^d \\\\in [0.11, 0.17]$ for $m_T \\\\in [1000, 1160]$ GeV at 3000 fb$^{-1}$.

These findings highlight the enhanced detection potential at higher energies, particularly with polarized beams. The effects of initial state radiation, beamstrahlung, and systematic uncertainties are also considered, influencing both exclusion and discovery capabilities. | Other | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15985v1) |\\n| Minimizing movements solutions for a monotone model of droplet motion | Carson Collins, William M Feldman | We study the uniqueness and regularity of minimizing movements', 'name': 'Scientist', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'Admin'}, {'content': 'The markdown table looks well-structured and includes all the necessary information.
